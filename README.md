# water-level-monitoring-linkitone
Monitoring water level in overhead tanks in apartment complex is a problem.Tank overflow/ water shortage are the result of poor monitoring. An attempt was made to address this problem with ultrasonic sensor mounted on overhead tanks. A plastic ball floating inside a pipe immersed in water which keeps moving up and down with waterlevel is used as part of sensing element and Ultrasonic sensor fixed on the top bounces ultrasonic waves on the ball. The algorithm keeps coverting this information to distance of ball from the sensor. By setting low level threshold (empty) and high level threshold (full) the pump operator is alerted  through an app for necessary action.Linkit One hardware with ultrasonic sensor was used for this project.
